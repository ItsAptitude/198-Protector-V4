## Tutorial: 
1. Download the file
2. Extract it somewhere on your PC
3. Run ConfuserEX.exe, this is the only file required as everything is packed into one executable
4. Have fun


## Disclaimer: 
* The presets do not work, so don't try and use them.
* SuperAntiDe4Dot will stop most unpackers from working, however it can not be used together with constant protection, so use it afterwards alone.
* This was created 2018 to compliment other protection, do not rely on it to stop people from cracking your software.
* Do not rename the file, it won't run if you do.
