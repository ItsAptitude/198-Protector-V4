Protector for .NET applications.

1. Download the file.
2. Extract it somewhere on your PC.
3. Run ConfuserEX.exe, this is the only file required as everything is packed into one executable. 
   Do not rename this file, it won't run if you do.
4. Have fun.

Some other information:
* The presets do not work, so don't try and use them.
* SuperAntiDe4Dot will stop most unpackers from working, however it can not be used together with constant protection, so use it afterwards alone.
* This was created 2018 to compliment other protection, do not rely on it to stop people from cracking your software.
